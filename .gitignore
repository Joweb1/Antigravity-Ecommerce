# The following line explicitly includes the 'product-images' directory within storage/app/public/
# This is to ensure product images are pushed to GitHub as requested.
# Be aware that committing user-uploaded or generated files directly to version control
# is generally not recommended for production environments. Consider persistent storage
# solutions (e.g., S3, Render Persistent Disks) for user-generated content.
